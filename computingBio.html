    <h1>Computing Biography</h1>
    <p id="computingBio">
      I've always had a passion for computers, toying around with JAVA and C++
      since I was in middle school, but I hadn't planned thought about pursuing
      a degree until just recently. Admittedly, while I have a great deal of
      respect for web developers, I've always been more interested in
      developing games and applications. Web development has started to grow on
      me in recent weeks, however.
